# 📦 Installation Guide – Cat in the Box (Nintendo Switch)

> ⚠️ **This game requires a modded Nintendo Switch.**  
> It will NOT work on an unmodified console.

Follow these steps carefully. Do not skip steps. Do not improvise.

---

## ✅ What You Need
- A **modded Nintendo Switch**
- A **microSD card** inside your Switch
- A **computer** (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- The following files:
  - `CatintheBox.nro`
  - `game` folder

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Installation

### 1️⃣ Download the Files
Download:
- `CatintheBox.nro`
- the `game` folder

Make sure:
- `CatintheBox.nro` is a file  
- `game` is a folder (not zipped)

---

### 2️⃣ Connect Your Switch to Your Computer
- Power off your Switch **or**
- Remove the microSD card and insert it into your computer

Either method is fine.

---

### 3️⃣ Open the `switch` Folder
On the microSD card:
- Open the folder named **`switch`**

This is the same folder where other `.nro` homebrew apps are located.

Example:
/switch/


---

### 4️⃣ Copy the Files (IMPORTANT)
Inside the **`switch`** folder:

- Place `CatintheBox.nro` directly into the `switch` folder
- Place the **entire** `game` folder into the `switch` folder

✅ Correct structure:
/switch/
├─ CatintheBox.nro
├─ game/


❌ Incorrect:
- `CatintheBox.nro` inside the `game` folder
- `game` inside another folder
- Renaming files or folders

Do **not** rename anything.

---

### 5️⃣ Launch the Game
1. Safely eject the microSD card (if removed)
2. Insert it back into the Switch (if needed)
3. Boot your Switch
4. Open **HBMenu (Homebrew Menu)**
5. Select **Cat in the Box**

The game should now start.

---

## 🆘 If It Doesn’t Work
- Double-check the folder structure
- Make sure the Switch is modded
- Make sure the files are not inside a zip
- Make sure `CatintheBox.nro` is in `/switch/`, not `/switch/game/`

If it still doesn’t launch, something is wrong with the setup.

---

Enjoy the game. 🐱📦
